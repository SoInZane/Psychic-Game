This JavaScript game called "The Physic Game" is a letter guessing game where the user tries to guess the randomly generated letter chosen by the program. The user has 9 guesses to try and guess the correct letter and if they use all of those 9 guesses without guessing the correct letter they lose. Letters guessed will be tracked as well as the wins and losses. 

Do you think you can guess the correct letter? Give it a shot.
